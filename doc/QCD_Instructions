This file describes the procedure to determine the QCD multi-jet contribution
to the final N_eejj or N_enujj samples, and to perform the closure test.

The DATA sample needed is always the SuperCluster Skim.
For the MC samples, an Electron Skim is sufficient (since MC is used to 
determine contamination from real electrons or converted photons, and this
contamination is negligible for sample where only superclusters are requested
while it may be not negligible for samples where an electron is requested).


1) Determine the Fake Rates:
   -------------------------
   Fake rates have to be determined using data and MC (for estimating real 
   electron/photon contamination) with 2 different selections:

   a) requesting 1 isoSC + 2 jets (needed for closure test and enujj analysis) 
   b) requesting 1 isoSC + 3 jets (needed eejj analysis)

   Run twice (for a and for b) the rootNtupleAnalyzerV2 with the macro
     analysisClass_SCFakeRate.C 
   and cut file
     cutTable_SCFakeRate.txt
   where you set the cut on nJet_PtCut as:

   a) nJet_PtCut                      1          +inf                 -               -               0       16 -0.5 15.5 
   b) nJet_PtCut                      2          +inf                 -               -               0       16 -0.5 15.5 

   This will produce histograms with distributions of HEEP electrons and isolated
   superculsters passing the selection cuts:

   h_goodSCPt_Barrel (the denominator of the fake rate for EB)
   h_goodEleSCPt_Barrel (the numerator of the fake rate for EB)
   h_goodSCPt_Endcap (the denominator of the fake rate for EE)
   h_goodEleSCPt_Endcap (the numerator of the fake rate for EE)

   Do the usual check/combine/merge for both a and b.

   The above histograms will be used by the macro 
   rootNtupleMacrosV2/plotting/QCD_FakeRate_fitting.py 
   to produce fake rate plots for the endcap and barrel,
   to perform a linear fit, and to print to screen the
   fake rate values. 
   Edit the macro and change File2....

FIXME: 
to take use the output of 
   analysisClass_SCFakeRate.C as the input.
   Run this macro to produce fake rate plots for the endcap and barrel 
   and to perform the linear fit.
   The fit parameters are printed to the screen, the barrel first and then the endcap.

FIXME:
   ---- Check to contamination and rescale the fake rates to account for it (add details here)


2) Predict number of QCD events to final analysis sample:
   ------------------------------------------------------

  2a) enujj analysis: predict n. of enujj events using cnujj events
  2b) eejj analysis: predict n. of eejj events using ccjj events


  2a) Use macro analysisClass_enujjSample_QCD.C  
      and cut file cutTable_enujjSample_QCD.txt
  2b) Use macro analysisClass_eejjSample_QCD.C  
      and cut file cutTable_eejjSample_QCD.txt

  Edit the precut lines for:
    fakeRate_Barrel	      
    fakeRate_Endcap	      
  for the cut file of 2a) or 2b) and set the fake rates from 1a) or 1b).

  Run the macros+cuts file on DATA only (electron/photon contamination is 
  negligible for the ccjj or cnujj samples). 
  QCD bkg plots will be found in the final root files.

  NOTE: remember that the int. lumi for the SuperCluster Skim is usually different
  than the one for the Electron skim. Use the appropriate value when using
  ./scripts/combineTablesTemplate.py 
  ./scripts/combinePlotsTemplate.py 

3) Run the ecj closure test (occasionally):
   ----------------------------------------

   - the code is 
     analysisClass_ecj_ClosureTest.C
     cutTable_ecj_ClosureTest.txt
   
   a) Predict the number of ecj events:

     - modify cutTable_ecj_ClosureTest.txt:
       - take the contamination-corrected from 1a) and set them in the lines
         fakeRate_Barrel       .005092      0
         fakeRate_Endcap       .01836       0
       - remove the request of electrons by setting:
         nEle_HEEP                       -inf         +inf

     - modify analysisClass_ecj_ClosureTest.C:
       - uncomment the line 
         double weight = p1+p2;
       - comment the line
         double weight = 1;

     - make clean; make 

     - run the macro on data only (contamination of the ccj sample is negligible, no need
     to estimate it from MC)

   b) Determine the true number of ecj events:

     - modify cutTable_ecj_ClosureTest.txt:
       - add the request of 1 or more electrons by setting:
         nEle_HEEP                       0         +inf

     - modify analysisClass_ecj_ClosureTest.C:
       - comment the line
         double weight = p1+p2;
       - uncomment the line
         double weight = 1;

     - make clean; make 

     - run the macro on data and MC (contamination of the ecj sample is substantial)



FIXME --- old instructions below

3) Adjust the fake rate fit parameters in the cutTable_SCPredictions.txt
   and run analysisClass_SCPredictions.C on the data.
   This produces histograms for pT and ST distributions for the
   "ttjj" sample, which corresponds to the N_eejj sample.
   The integral of this histogram is the predicted number of N_eejj events
   and the number of entries is the number of ssjj events reweighted.
   The distributions for "tsj" are for electron-supercluster-jet events
   for the closure test.  There is a histogram for "actual" and a histogram for
   "predicted".
   More detailed instructions are contained in the code itself.

Predicting number of events at pre-cuts levels:
1) Adjust the cutTable_eejjSample.txt to make sure the requirement of 2 electrons
   is the first analysis specific cut (after beam scraping, good vertex, etc.).
   Edit analysisClass_eejj_QCD.C to contain the correct fake rate value for barrel
   and endcap.
   Run analysisClass_eejj_QCD.C.
   Histograms are filled with weights assuming exactly 2 superclusters in the event
   and that both convert to HEEP electrons.

Adjusting fake rate and closure test due to SM contamination:
1) Run the analysisClass_SCFakeRate code over MC samples from SM processes
   in order to estimate the total contribution to the numerator of the fake rate 
   for the integrated luminosity of data considered.
   Calculate contribution in barrel and endcap separately.
   PhotonJet is the only processes seen so far to contribute significantly.
   The contributions to the denominator have been negligible.

2) Calculate what percentage of the DATA numerator the SM MC
   predictions account for.  ( # PhotonJet MC numerator / # Data numerator)

3) Reduce the fake rates calculated in the barrel and endcap from data by the
   percentage calculated in step 2.  This is the new, "adjusted" fake rate.

4) To adjust the closure, run analysisClass_SCPredictions.C over SM MC samples.
   In this version of the analysis have used W+Jet, Z+Jet, TTbar, PhotonJet, and VV.
   Calculate number of electron-supercluster-jet events pass all cuts in SM MC.
   Subtract this number from the "actual" number of e-s-j events in data before
   comparing to the "predicted" number in data (the reweighted s-s-j events).
